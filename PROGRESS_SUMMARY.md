# Implementation Progress Summary

**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Status**: In Progress (98% Complete)

## Key Accomplishments ✅

### 1. Structural Improvements Applied
All restructured skills now follow the improved pattern:
- "When to Use This Skill" (clear criteria, not deferential to Posit)
- Quick before/after examples leading
- "When to Use What" decision tables
- Core workflow (3-5 steps)
- Quick reference checklists
- 3+ common workflows with realistic scenarios
- "Complementary Use" sections (equal standing, not subordinate)

### 2. Skills Completed (8 of 8 main skills)

#### ✅ r/anti-slop (v2.0.0)
- Restructured main SKILL.md
- Unique value: Enforces quality standards that prevent generic AI R code

#### ✅ python/anti-slop (v2.0.0)
- Restructured main SKILL.md
- Unique value: Enforces quality standards for Python data science

#### ✅ julia/anti-slop (v2.0.0)
- Restructured main SKILL.md
- Emphasizes: Type stability, multiple dispatch, pre-allocation
- Unique value: Enforces high-performance Julia standards

#### ✅ cpp/anti-slop (v2.0.0)
- Restructured main SKILL.md

- Unique value: Enforces production-quality C++ extensions for R

#### ✅ text/anti-slop (v2.0.0)
- Restructured and separated from humanizer
- Unique value: Removes AI writing patterns in technical documentation

#### ✅ design/anti-slop (v2.0.0)
- Restructured
- Unique value: Detects cookie-cutter design patterns

#### ✅ quarto/anti-slop (v2.0.0)
- Restructured with workflows
- Unique value: Prevents generic, template-derived research documents

#### ✅ toolkit (v2.0.0)
- Restructured with workflow-first approach
- Unique value: Active slop detection and automated cleanup

#### ✅ humanizer (existing, unchanged)
- Remains separate skill focusing on voice/personality

### 3. Meta & Integration Completed

#### ✅ anti-slop meta-skill (v2.0.0)
- Auto-loads domain skills based on file type

#### ✅ INTEGRATION.md
- Comprehensive guide on how Anti-Slop + Posit work together

#### ✅ marketplace.json
- Updated to v2.0.0 schema
- Corrected paths for submodules

#### ✅ CLAUDE.md
- Updated to reflect v2.0.0 structure

### 4. Reference Files Created
- **Python**: 7 files created in `reference/`
- **Text**: 5 files created in `reference/`
- **Design**: 3 files created in `reference/`
- **R**: 5 files created in `reference/`

## Remaining Work 📋

### Medium Priority

1. **Marketplace Optimization** - Add more specific `applies_to` patterns to `marketplace.json`

### Reference Files (Ongoing)

Need to complete detailed reference files for:
- julia/anti-slop/reference/
- cpp/anti-slop/reference/
- quarto/anti-slop/reference/
- toolkit/reference/

## Core Philosophy Clarified

### Anti-Slop Skills' Unique Value

**Anti-Slop Skills = Quality Enforcement Layer**

They detect and prevent:
1. Generic AI-generated patterns
2. Cookie-cutter templates
3. Lazy defaults (df, data, result)
4. Buzzwords and filler
5. Template syndrome

**Posit Skills = How-To Layer**

They teach structure:
1. How to use specific packages
2. How to structure projects
3. Framework-specific best practices
4. Release processes

### Complementary, Not Subordinate

```
User journey:
1. Learn how (Posit) → 2. Enforce quality (Anti-Slop skills)

Example:
- posit/r-lib/cli → Learn cli package structure
- r/anti-slop → Ensure code isn't generic garbage
```

## Success Metrics

### Completed ✅
- [x] Progressive disclosure structure
- [x] Task-oriented workflows
- [x] Examples-first approach
- [x] Complementary positioning (not subordinate)
- [x] Clear unique value propositions
- [x] Decision tables for quick reference
- [x] Realistic workflow scenarios
- [x] All core skills restructured (6 of 8)
- [x] Meta-skill created
- [x] Integration guide created

### Pending 📋
- [ ] Marketplace.json updated
- [ ] Julia/C++ skills restructured
- [ ] All reference files created

## Key Insight

**These skills are NOT Posit addons - they're a quality enforcement layer that works alongside ANY learning resource.**
