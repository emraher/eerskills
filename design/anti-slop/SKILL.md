# Design Anti-Slop Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Use design-anti-slop when:
- ✓ Reviewing AI-generated designs before implementation
- ✓ Conducting design audits for generic patterns
- ✓ Catching "template syndrome" in landing pages
- ✓ Ensuring brand authenticity in visual design
- ✓ Teaching design quality standards to teams
- ✓ Detecting the "AI startup aesthetic"

Do NOT use when:
- Following specific brand guidelines that happen to use common patterns
- Working with established design systems (different context)
- Intentionally using templates for rapid prototyping

## Quick Example

**Before (AI Design Slop)**:
- Purple/pink/cyan mesh gradient hero
- "Empower Your Business" headline
- Three feature cards with generic icons
- Floating 3D geometric shapes
- Stats section with big numbers
- Generic testimonials
- "Get Started Today" CTA

**After (Authentic Design)**:
- Brand-specific color palette
- Specific value proposition headline
- Content-driven layout based on user needs
- Visual elements that serve purpose
- Real customer data/quotes with context
- Clear, action-oriented CTA

**What changed**:
- ✓ Removed generic gradient background
- ✓ Replaced buzzword headline with specific value
- ✓ Designed layout for actual content, not template
- ✓ Eliminated decorative 3D elements
- ✓ Used authentic customer proof
- ✓ Specified the action, not generic "get started"

## When to Use What

| If you see... | Red flag because... | Better approach |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Purple/pink/cyan gradient | "AI startup" cliché | Brand colors, solid backgrounds |
| "Empower your business" | Generic buzzword headline | Specific value: "Cut API response time 80%" |
| Floating 3D shapes | Decorative without purpose | Purpose-driven visuals or remove |
| Everything in cards | Template thinking | Vary layouts based on content type |
| Inter for everything | Default font choice | Fonts matching brand personality |
| Center-aligned everything | Lazy symmetry | Intentional alignment, left for readability |
| Generic icon + text cards | Cookie-cutter pattern | Content-first layout variations |
| "Get Started" CTA | Vague action | Specific: "Start Free Trial" "Download Report" |

## Core Workflow

### 3-Step Slop Detection

1. **Visual audit** - Scan for generic patterns
   ```
   Check for:
   - Generic gradients (purple/pink/cyan mesh)
   - Floating 3D geometric shapes
   - Glass morphism overuse
   - Stock photo aesthetics
   - Same font for everything (usually Inter)
   ```

2. **Layout audit** - Check structure
   ```
   Red flags:
   - Cookie-cutter landing page template
   - Everything in cards
   - Center-aligned everything
   - Identical spacing everywhere
   - Template-driven, not content-driven
   ```

3. **Copy audit** - Review microcopy
   ```
   Buzzword alerts:
   - "Empower your business"
   - "Take control of your future"
   - "Unlock your potential"
   - "Seamless experience"
   - Generic CTAs ("Get Started", "Learn More")
   ```

## Quick Reference Checklist

Design slop indicators:

- [ ] Purple/pink/cyan gradient background
- [ ] Floating 3D shapes (cubes, spheres, toruses)
- [ ] Glass morphism on every element
- [ ] Stock photo aesthetics (diverse workplace, people pointing at screens)
- [ ] Inter for all text
- [ ] Everything in cards
- [ ] Everything center-aligned
- [ ] "Empower your business" type headlines
- [ ] Generic three-column feature layout
- [ ] Stats section with big numbers but no context
- [ ] Fake-looking testimonials
- [ ] Generic pricing cards
- [ ] "Get Started Today" CTA

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Audit Landing Page Design

**Context**: Reviewing a landing page for generic AI patterns.

**Steps**:

1. **Check hero section**
   ```
   Red flags:
   - Gradient mesh background (purple/pink/cyan)
   - "Empower/Transform/Revolutionize Your Business"
   - Generic stock photo or 3D shapes
   - Center-aligned everything

   Better:
   - Brand-specific colors
   - Specific value prop: "Process 10k transactions/sec"
   - Real product screenshot or authentic imagery
   - Strategic alignment
   ```

2. **Check features section**
   ```
   Red flags:
   - Exactly three cards
   - Generic icons (rocket, shield, chart)
   - "Feature 1" "Feature 2" "Feature 3" layout
   - All cards identical size regardless of content

   Better:
   - Content-driven layout (2, 4, 5 items if that's what you need)
   - Specific icons or remove them
   - Vary presentation based on feature importance
   - Size cards based on content
   ```

3. **Check social proof**
   ```
   Red flags:
   - Generic testimonials with stock photos
   - "10k+ users" "99% satisfaction" without context
   - Logo wall of companies you can't verify

   Better:
   - Real customer quotes with full names, roles, companies
   - Specific metrics: "Reduced support tickets 40% in Q3 2024"
   - Verifiable customer relationships
   ```

4. **Check CTA**
   ```
   Red flags:
   - "Get Started"
   - "Learn More"
   - "Try for Free"
   - Gradient button with excessive shadow

   Better:
   - Specific action: "Start 14-Day Trial" "Download Whitepaper"
   - "See Live Demo" "Request Pricing"
   - Simple, clear button styling
   ```

**Expected outcome**: Landing page that reflects actual product/brand

### Workflow 2: Review SaaS Dashboard Design

**Context**: Checking for generic dashboard patterns.

**Steps**:

1. **Check color usage**
   ```
   Red flags:
   - Purple accent color (generic SaaS palette)
   - Pastel everything
   - Pure black (#000) and pure white (#FFF)

   Better:
   - Brand-specific palette
   - Functional color system (success, warning, error)
   - Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
   ```

2. **Check layout patterns**
   ```
   Red flags:
   - Every section in a card
   - Cards within cards
   - Everything spaced identically
   - Floating elements with excessive shadows

   Better:
   - Vary visual treatment based on content type
   - Group related data visually
   - Use spacing to create hierarchy
   - Subtle shadows where needed for depth
   ```

3. **Check data visualization**
   ```
   Red flags:
   - Default chart library colors
   - Gradients on every chart
   - 3D charts (rarely useful)
   - Decorative animations

   Better:
   - Purpose-driven color choices
   - Simple, readable charts
   - 2D charts (easier to read)
   - Animation only for state changes
   ```

**Expected outcome**: Dashboard that prioritizes data clarity over aesthetics

### Workflow 3: Review Mobile App Design

**Context**: Checking mobile UI for generic patterns.

**Steps**:

1. **Check navigation**
   ```
   Red flags:
   - Generic bottom tab bar with 5 items
   - Icons without labels
   - Hamburger menu for everything

   Better:
   - Navigation based on user flow
   - Most important actions surfaced
   - Labels for clarity
   - Consider alternatives to hamburger
   ```

2. **Check components**
   ```
   Red flags:
   - Fully rounded buttons (pill shape)
   - Gradient buttons everywhere
   - Ghost buttons as primary CTAs
   - Every input has an icon inside

   Better:
   - Appropriate border radius (4-8px usually)
   - Style hierarchy (primary solid, secondary outline)
   - Icons in inputs only when helpful
   ```

3. **Check typography**
   ```
   Red flags:
   - Same font family for everything
   - Body text < 16px
   - Insufficient line height (< 1.5)
   - Center-aligned paragraphs

   Better:
   - Clear hierarchy with font sizes/weights
   - Readable body text (16px+)
   - Comfortable line height (1.5-1.8)
   - Left-aligned body text
   ```

**Expected outcome**: Mobile UI that serves users, not trends

## High-Confidence Slop Patterns

These are almost always AI-generated or template-derived:

### Visual
- **Purple (#7F5AF0) + Cyan (#2CB67D) + Pink (#FF6AC1) palette** - The "AI startup" gradient
- **Floating 3D geometric shapes** - Cubes, spheres, toruses with no purpose
- **Glassmorphism on everything** - Blurred backgrounds, frosted glass effects overused
- **Stock workplace diversity photos** - Generic "people collaborating" imagery

### Layout
- **Exact three-column feature cards** - The universal AI template
- **Everything in cards** - Cards within cards within cards
- **Hero → 3 features → stats → testimonials → pricing → CTA** - The AI landing page formula
- **Center-aligned everything** - Lazy symmetry without purpose

### Typography
- **Inter for everything** - The default modern font choice
- **Montserrat + Open Sans** - The generic pairing
- **Excessive font variation** - 5+ fonts trying to look "designed"

### Copy
- **"Empower your business"** - Generic value prop
- **"Seamless experience"** - Meaningless modifier
- **"Get Started" CTA** - Vague action
- **"Trusted by industry leaders"** - Unverifiable claim

## Context Matters

Not all patterns are always slop:

- **Brand guidelines** - If brand actually uses purple, it's authentic
- **Industry standards** - Some patterns are conventions (e.g., ecommerce layouts)
- **Accessibility** - Some "generic" patterns exist for good UX reasons
- **Established systems** - Material Design, iOS HIG have reasons for patterns

The issue is **thoughtless copying** without considering if it serves your specific users and content.

- **humanizer** - For making design copy sound human

### Tools

Design audit workflow:
1. Screenshot key sections
2. Compare against generic AI patterns
3. Identify specific slop instances
4. Redesign based on content/brand needs

## Complementary Use

Design anti-slop focuses on **pattern detection**. It doesn't teach design principles.

For learning design:
- Study design systems: Material Design, iOS HIG, Polaris
- Learn accessibility: WCAG guidelines
- Study color theory, typography, layout principles

This skill helps you **avoid generic AI output** once you know what you're doing.
