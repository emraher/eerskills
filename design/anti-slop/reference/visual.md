# Visual Design Slop Patterns

AI-generated designs often rely on a specific set of "modern SaaS" clichés that make products feel generic and untrustworthy. Identify and replace these patterns to create authentic, brand-aligned interfaces.

## The "AI Startup" Aesthetic

High-probability indicators of generic AI or template-derived visual design.

### 1. The Mesh Gradient Hero
- **Pattern**: Soft, blurred gradients of purple, pink, and cyan (#7F5AF0, #2CB67D, #FF6AC1).
- **Why it's slop**: It has become the universal "we don't have a brand" default.
- **Better Approach**: Use brand-specific colors, solid backgrounds, or purposeful imagery.

### 2. Floating 3D Primitives
- **Pattern**: Glassy or matte 3D cubes, spheres, and toruses floating around headers.
- **Why it's slop**: They are decorative filler that doesn't communicate value.
- **Better Approach**: Use product screenshots, diagrams, or meaningful illustrations.

### 3. Glassmorphism Overuse
- **Pattern**: Blurred, semi-transparent backgrounds with thin white borders on every card and modal.
- **Why it's slop**: It often hurts accessibility and makes the UI feel "floaty" and imprecise.
- **Better Approach**: Use solid containers with clear hierarchy through elevation (subtle shadows) or color.

### 4. Default Inter Font
- **Pattern**: Using Inter for every single text element without adjustment.
- **Why it's slop**: While Inter is a great font, using it as a "set and forget" default misses an opportunity for brand personality.
- **Better Approach**: Pair fonts (e.g., a serif for headers, sans for body) or adjust Inter's weight/tracking.

## Color Clichés

- **"SaaS Blue"** (#0061FF) - The generic "trust" color.
- **Pastel everything** - Lacks contrast and energy.
- **Pure Black (#000) on Pure White (#FFF)** - Can cause eye strain; use slightly off-whites and dark grays for a more professional feel.

## Data Visualization Slop

Generic AI often generates "aesthetic" charts that are functionally useless.

| Slop Pattern | Why it's bad | Better Approach |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 3D Bar/Pie charts | Hard to read values | 2D charts are easier to compare |
| Gradients on lines | Can obscure data trends | Use solid lines with distinct colors |
| Missing axis labels | Form over function | Always label axes and provide legends |
| Meaningless "growth" curves | Marketing fluff | Show real data or don't use a chart |

## Imagery Slop

- **Diverse workplace stock photos** - People in high-fives or pointing at laptop screens.
- **Generic abstract tech backgrounds** - Glowing nodes and connections.
- **AI-generated "uncanny" people** - People with six fingers or mismatched ears.

## Workflow: De-Sloping Visuals

1. **Check the hero**: Is there a mesh gradient and a 3D cube? If yes, start here.
2. **Audit color usage**: Are colors chosen because they are "modern" or because they reflect the brand?
3. **Check typography**: Is there a clear hierarchy? Does the font match the tone of the product?
4. **Remove decorative fluff**: Delete any 3D shapes or glass effects that don't serve a functional purpose.
5. **Verify accessibility**: Use a contrast checker (e.g., Stark) to ensure the "aesthetic" isn't excluding users.
