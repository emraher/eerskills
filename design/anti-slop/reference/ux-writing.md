# UX Writing and Microcopy Patterns

The text inside your UI (buttons, labels, headers) is as important as the visual design. Replace generic AI-generated copy with specific, action-oriented writing.

## The "AI Microcopy" Catalog

AI-generated UI often defaults to vague, "inspiring" language that doesn't tell the user what to do.

| Generic Copy | Why it's slop | Better Approach |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "Get Started" | Vague action | "Start 14-Day Free Trial", "Create Account" |
| "Learn More" | Low intent | "See How it Works", "Read Full Case Study" |
| "Empower Your Business" | Generic buzzword | "Increase Sales 20%", "Automate Your Invoicing" |
| "Click Here" | Not accessible | The button text should describe the destination |
| "Submit" | Cold, mechanical | "Send Message", "Save Profile", "Join Community" |

## Headline Patterns

AI headlines are often "significance inflated" – they try to sound revolutionary but say nothing.

- **Bad**: "Unlock the Future of Data Management"
- **Good**: "Query 100TB in Seconds"

- **Bad**: "Revolutionizing the Way Teams Collaborate"
- **Good**: "Shared Context for Engineering Teams"

## Button Text (CTAs)

A good CTA should complete the sentence "I want to..."

- **Bad**: "Explore"
- **Good**: "Browse Templates"

- **Bad**: "Connect"
- **Good**: "Sync with GitHub"

## Error Messages and Tooltips

AI error messages are often overly polite or vague.

- **Bad**: "Something went wrong. Please try again later."
- **Good**: "Invalid password. Must contain at least one number."

- **Bad**: "Click this icon for more information."
- **Good**: "Click to view API usage limits."

## Tone and Voice

Technical UI should be:
1. **Direct**: Don't use three words when one will do.
2. **Helpful**: Focus on what the user can *do*.
3. **Transparent**: Explain what happens after an action (e.g., "No credit card required").
4. **Human**: Avoid mechanical or overly formal language.

## Workflow: Improving Your Microcopy

1. **The "Sentence Completion" Test**: Does the button text complete "I want to..."?
2. **Remove the Buzzwords**: Strip out "empower", "leverage", "seamless", "cutting-edge".
3. **Be Specific**: Replace "data" with "records", "files", or "users".
4. **Action First**: Start headers and buttons with strong verbs.
5. **Read it Aloud**: If it sounds like a corporate brochure, simplify it.
