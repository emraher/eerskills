# Buzzwords and Replacements

Buzzwords obscure meaning and make technical writing feel generic and untrustworthy. Replace them with plain, specific language.

## The "Slop" Catalog

These words often appear in AI-generated "marketing-technical" hybrids.

| Buzzword | Why it's slop | Better Alternatives |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| "Leverage" | Corporate jargon | "Use", "Employ", "Utilize" |
| "Empower" | Vague, overused | "Enable", "Allow", "Help" |
| "Seamless" | Rarely true, cliché | "Automatic", "Integrated", "Easy" |
| "Synergy" | Corporate fluff | "Cooperation", "Integration" |
| "Robust" | Overused, imprecise | "Reliable", "Scalable", "Strong" |
| "Paradigm shift" | Dramatic cliché | "New approach", "Change" |
| "Holistic" | Vague | "Complete", "Comprehensive" |
| "Cutting-edge" | Meaningless fluff | "New", "Modern", "Current" |
| "End-to-end" | Overused | Describe the specific stages |
| "Scalable" | Often used without proof | Specify the limits or delete |

## Significant Inflation Buzzwords

AI tends to use superlatives that don't add value.

- **"Unparalleled"** → "High", "Significant"
- **"Unleash"** → "Start", "Use"
- **"Transformative"** → Describe the specific change
- **"Elevate"** → "Improve", "Increase"
- **"Optimize"** → Be specific: "Reduce latency", "Increase throughput"

## Filler Buzzwords

These words are used to make simple concepts sound more complex.

- **"Utilize"** → "Use" (almost always)
- **"Functionality"** → "Feature", "Behavior"
- **"Implement"** → "Write", "Build", "Create"
- **"Solution"** → "Tool", "Library", "Service"
- **"Methodology"** → "Method", "Approach"

## Industry Jargon to Watch

If you are writing for a general technical audience, avoid or define these:

- **"Low-hanging fruit"** → "Easy tasks"
- **"Double-click on"** → "Examine", "Details of"
- **"Circle back"** → "Discuss later"
- **"Bandwidth"** → "Time", "Capacity"

## Workflow: De-Buzzing Your Text

1. **Highlight the "Big 5"**: Search for "leverage", "empower", "seamless", "solution", "robust".
2. **Apply the "Use" Test**: If you can replace a word with "use" and it still makes sense, the original word was likely a buzzword.
3. **Be Specific**: Instead of saying something is "robust," explain *why* (e.g., "handles 10k requests/sec", "recovers automatically from crashes").
4. **Remove Superlatives**: Strip out "best-in-class", "world-class", "unparalleled". Let the features speak for themselves.
5. **Human Check**: Read the sentence. If you wouldn't say it to a colleague over coffee, it's likely too buzzword-heavy.
