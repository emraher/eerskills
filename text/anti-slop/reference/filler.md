# Eliminating Filler and Wordy Phrases

Filler phrases add length but dilute the message. Technical writing should be concise and direct.

## Common Wordy Constructions

Replace multi-word phrases with single, direct words.

| Wordy Phrase | Better Alternative |
|--------------|--------------------|
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "Due to the fact that" | "Because" |
| "In the event that" | "If" |
| "Has the ability to" | "Can" |
| "With the exception of" | "Except" |
| "A large number of" | "Many" |
| "In a timely manner" | "Quickly", "Soon" |
| "At this point in time" | "Now" |
| "Prior to" | "Before" |
| "Subsequent to" | "After" |

## Empty Intensifiers

These words try to add emphasis but often weaken the statement.

- **"Very"** → Delete or use a more specific word
- **"Really"** → Delete
- **"Quite"** → Delete
- **"Basically"** → Delete
- **"Actually"** → Delete
- **"Literally"** → Delete (unless actually literal)
- **"Extremely"** → Use sparingly or delete

## Hedging and Uncertainly

AI often adds "softening" phrases that make technical advice sound unsure.

| Hedging Phrase | Why it's slop | Better Approach |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "It appears that" | Unsure | "Is", "Does", or delete |
| "It could potentially" | Redundant | "It can", "It might" |
| "It would seem that" | Passive | Delete and state the point |
| "Might possibly" | Redundant | "Might" |
| "It's worth considering" | Filler | State the recommendation |

## Passive to Active Voice

Passive voice often introduces filler (is, by, being).

- **Passive**: "The data was processed by the system." (7 words)
- **Active**: "The system processed the data." (5 words)

- **Passive**: "It is recommended that the cache be cleared." (8 words)
- **Active**: "Clear the cache." (3 words)

## Redundant Pairs

Stop using two words when one will do.

- **"First and foremost"** → "First"
- **"Each and every"** → "Every"
- **"Basic and fundamental"** → "Basic"
- **"Final and conclusive"** → "Final"
- **"Null and void"** → "Void"

## Workflow: Tightening Your Prose

1. **Delete "In order to"**: It is the most common filler phrase. "To" is always better.
2. **Scan for "-ly" words**: Many adverbs (actually, basically, really) are filler.
3. **Look for "It is..." and "There are..."**: These often lead to wordy sentences.
   - "There are three options available." → "Three options are available."
4. **The "Delete Test"**: Delete a word or phrase. If the meaning doesn't change, the word was filler.
5. **Combine Sentences**: If you have two short sentences connected by a filler transition, combine them with "and" or "but".
