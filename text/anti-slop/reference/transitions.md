# Overused Transitions to Avoid

AI-generated text often relies on a predictable set of transition phrases that add length without adding meaning. Remove or replace these to create more direct, human-sounding technical writing.

## The "AI Signature" Transitions

These phrases are high-probability indicators of generic AI output.

| High-Risk Phrase | Why it's slop | Better Approach |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "Delve into" | Overly dramatic, cliché | "Examine", "Discuss", or delete |
| "Navigate the complexities" | Vague, dramatic | Describe the specific challenge |
| "Unlock the potential" | Marketing fluff | Describe the specific benefit |
| "In today's fast-paced world" | Meaningless preamble | State the current context directly |
| "At the end of the day" | Filler cliché | "Ultimately" or delete |
| "Take a closer look at" | Meta-commentary | Lead with the observation |

## Redundant Connectors

Many transitions can be removed entirely with no loss of meaning.

| Phrase | Action | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| "Furthermore" | Delete or use "Also" | "The system is fast. Furthermore, it's secure." → "The system is fast and secure." |
| "Moreover" | Delete | "Moreover, we added a new API." → "We also added an API." |
| "Additionally" | Delete or "Also" | "Additionally, check the logs." → "Check the logs." |
| "Consequently" | Use "So" or "Therefore" | "Consequently, the build failed." → "So the build failed." |
| "In addition to" | Use "Also" | "In addition to R, we use Python." → "We use R and Python." |

## Significance Inflation

AI often tries to make simple steps sound revolutionary.

- **"Crucial role"** → "Used for"
- **"Game-changer"** → "Improves X"
- **"Revolutionary"** → Describe the specific change
- **"Landscape"** (e.g., "In the technical landscape") → "In the industry" or delete

## Direct Alternatives

| If you want to say... | Use this... | Instead of... |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Cause/Effect | "Because", "So" | "Due to the fact that", "Consequently" |
| Contrast | "But", "Yet" | "On the other hand", "Conversely" |
| Addition | "And", "Also" | "Moreover", "Furthermore" |
| Summary | "In short", "Finally" | "In conclusion", "To summarize" |

## Workflow: Cleaning Transitions

1. **Search for "AI signatures"**: Look for "delve", "navigate", "unlock".
2. **Read aloud**: If the transition feels like a "stage direction," it's probably slop.
3. **Delete first**: Try removing the transition. If the sentence still makes sense and flows, leave it out.
4. **Use simple words**: If a connector is needed, choose the shortest one (e.g., "but" over "however").
5. **Vary sentence structure**: Instead of using a transition word, start the next sentence with the subject to maintain momentum.
